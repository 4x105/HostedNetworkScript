Windows Batch Script to create a hosted network

"Hosted Network" allows you to turn your computer into a wireless hotspot.

Hosted Network is a feature that comes included with the Netsh (Network Shell) command-line utility. 
It's was previously introduced in Windows 7, and it allows you to use the operating system to create a virtual wireless adapter and create a SoftAP, 
which is a software-based wireless access point.
